## Type of data structure

### Array vs Linked List
1. Array 
* Array length should be fixed in advance
* Frequent copy of data occured in deletion of data
* Convenient reference data based on index of array

2. Linked List
* A linked list stores data in linear order
* way better performance in deteltion or insertion in items
* discordance between logical and physical storage items
